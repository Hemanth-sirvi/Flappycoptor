# Floppycoptor - a flappyBird remake


Flappycoptor is a flappyBird clone that i created using lua and LÃ¶ve2D game engine

The game itself is pretty self-explainotary, you have a flappy bird (helicotpor in this case) in the middle of the screen, your aim is to keep it flying without crashing to ground or to incomming pipes.

the code is reffereced from cs50's fiftybird (from the course cs50's introduction to game development: lecture2)
all the images are drawn using Pixel studio
